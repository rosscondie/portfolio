          Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ross and I love to build things with code !
          <br />
          <br />
          My first experience with programming happened when I was 14, at a time
          where Myspace was all the rage and allowed me to experiment with HTML
          and CSS to customise my profile. The world of coding intrigued me but
          it remained a fleeting fascination during my teenage years.
          <br />
          <br />
          At 19, I studied Sound Engineering and my interest in software
          development was reignited. I found customisable VST instruments for
          drum machines that sparked an interest into coding once again. I saw
          the potential of software in sound production and wanted to explore it
          further.
          <br />
          <br />
          My journey didn't stop there. I've continued to refine my skills and
          expand my knowledge. Most recently, I graduated from{' '}
          <a href={CCSYLLABUS}>CodeClan's</a> intensive 16-week Software
          Development Bootcamp. Equipping myself with a solid foundation in
          modern web technologies. I'm now on the lookout for a full-time role
          where I can leverage my coding skills to contribute towards a
          company's sucess.
